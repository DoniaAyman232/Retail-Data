Retail Data Warehousing Project with IBM InfoSphere DataStage
Overview
This project demonstrates the process of translating a logical data model to a physical data model and creating an ETL solution using IBM InfoSphere DataStage. The ETL solution loads data into files or databases based on business needs and includes the creation of data marts and answering specific business questions.

Modeling Process
The logical data model has been translated to a physical data model.
Samples of the physical data model and loaded data are available in the attached files.
ETL Solution
Using IBM InfoSphere DataStage, the ETL solution reads source data and applies transformations to serve business needs.
Files or databases are used as targets based on the specific requirements of the business.
